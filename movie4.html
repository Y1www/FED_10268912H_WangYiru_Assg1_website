                <h2>The Last Dance</h2>
                <p>Synopsis
                    The pandemic has sent most industries into recession. Mired in debt, wedding planner Dominic (Dayo WONG) gets a miraculous chance to turn things around when a funeral planner retires and passes the baton to him. Planning weddings and funerals are polar opposites, but Dominic puts his all into his new job, from opening graves, digging coffins, to handling the deceased. No matter how unpleasant it gets, he takes on everything with gusto. However, the biggest obstacle is getting the approval of respected Taoist priest, Master Man (Michael HUI).
                    
                    In his 70s, Master Man is a traditional man who has devoted his life to his Taoist faith. He wants to pass the mantle to his son, Ben (Tommy CHU), but Ben is more devoted to his wife and kids than to Taoism. Master Man’s daughter, Yuet (Michelle WAI), respects her father greatly. However, since her ancestors dictated that women are filthy by nature, Yuet doesn’t take romantic relationships seriously.
                    
                    Estranged from his parents, Dominic doesn’t care much for family, and his years of working at weddings taught him that marriage is merely a piece of paper. Fortunately, his understanding girlfriend, Jade (Catherine CHAU), helps him fend off her parents’ attempt to rush them into marriage. They have mastered the art of getting along.
                    
                    Using his experience, Dominic plans funerals like weddings, throwing in growth montage videos, photo spots and even live streaming. These gimmicks help his business rake in cash, but his deviance from traditions also create many obstacles for him. But thanks to Master Man’s help, Dominic is able to do his job. Dominic realizes that funerals are not about sending off the dead, but sending off the living by giving them a chance to bid farewell to the dead.</p>
